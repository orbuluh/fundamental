<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring.

The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],
                ["e","t","a","e"],
                ["i","h","k","r"],
                ["i","f","l","v"]],

## [:exploding_head: 336. Palindrome Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/) [:dart:](palindrome_pair.h)

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
You are given a 0-indexed array of unique strings words.

A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:
- 0 <= i, j < word.length
- i != j, and
- words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome string.

Return an array of all the palindrome pairs of words.

Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]
```
