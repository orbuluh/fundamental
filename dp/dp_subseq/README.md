<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
Given an integer array `nums`,
return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array
by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
