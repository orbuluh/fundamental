## [:bulb: 473. Matchsticks to Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/matchsticks-to-square/) [:dart:](matchsticks_to_square.h)
- might be harder to not get TLE than you originally think!
<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
You are given an integer array matchsticks where
- matchsticks[i] is the length of the ith matchstick.

You want to use all the matchsticks to make one square.
- You should not break any stick
- but you can link them up
- and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

Return true if you can make this square and false otherwise.

Input: matchsticks = [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.
(1+1 / 2 / 2 / 2)

Input: matchsticks = [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.
