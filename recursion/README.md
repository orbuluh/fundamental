# Recursion

- Note: When thinking about the complexity ... recursion can be thought of as n nested loops where in each loop the number of iterations decreases by one.
- See also [really tricky recursion DP questions](../dp/README.md#really-tricky-dp-recursion)

## [:ok_hand: 38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/) [:dart:](count_and_say.h)

- not hard but think about how to implement it cleanly

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the way you would
- "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a
  different digit string.
- To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of
  substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit.
- Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit.
- Finally, concatenate every said digit.

Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"

Explanation:
- countAndSay(1) = "1"
- countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
- countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
- countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
