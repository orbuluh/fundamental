# Recursion

- Note: When thinking about the complexity ... recursion can be thought of as n nested loops where in each loop the number of iterations decreases by one.

## [:ok_hand: 38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/) / [:man_technologist:](count_and_say.h)

- not hard but think about how to implement it cleanly

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the way you would
- "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a
  different digit string.
- To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of
  substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit.
- Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit.
- Finally, concatenate every said digit.

Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"

Explanation:
- countAndSay(1) = "1"
- countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
- countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
- countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist
different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any
child of a is an ancestor of b.


Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

You may assume that the input string is always valid;

Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only.
We want to represent the grid with a Quad-Tree.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly
four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

- val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or
       False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
- isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or
          False if the node has the four children.
- Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf
is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
