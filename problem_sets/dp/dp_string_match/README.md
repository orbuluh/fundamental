# DP: String match

```markdown
- A common trait is building a 2-D DP matrix and think from the back of 2 strings.
- e.g. DP represents subproblem to handle `s1[i:]` v.s. `s2[j:]`
- The base case is often time when (either one/both) string is empty.

## [:bulb: 72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/) / [:man_technologist:](edit_distance.h) [:snake:](edit_distance.py)

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations
required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation:
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

## [:bulb: 1035. Uncrossed Lines](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines) / [:man_technologist:](uncrossed_lines.h)

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2.

We write the integers of nums1 and nums2 (in the order they are given) on two
separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines:

- a straight line connecting two numbers nums1[i] and nums2[j] such that:

- nums1[i] == nums2[j], and
- the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints
(i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

Input: nums1 = [1,4,2], nums2 = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
```

## [:dizzy_face: 87. Scramble String](https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string) / [:man_technologist:](scramble_string.h)

<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

- If the length of the string is 1, stop.
- If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
  - Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index,
    i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
  - Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order
    i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
  - Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
- Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a
  scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.

Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true

Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
Output: false
```
