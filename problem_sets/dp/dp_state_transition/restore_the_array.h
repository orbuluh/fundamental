/*

it's like painting house

dp[i] = number of ways having a number ending at i
    idx = 0123
for val = 1327, k = 40
then dp[3] = dp[1] + dp[2], as 27 and 7 are all valid choices to end at 3.
So dp[1] (ending at val 3)ã€€and dp[2] (ending at val 2) will lead to the case of
dp[3] (ending at val 7)

(TODO: there are some optimization available, didn't check it this time.)
