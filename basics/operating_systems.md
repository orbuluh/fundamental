# TODO:
- processes, threads and concurrency issues.
- locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work.
- deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them.
- Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs,
- how context switching works,
- how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware.
- scheduling. the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.
