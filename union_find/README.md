<details><summary markdown="span">Question</summary>

```markdown
You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where
- each string equations[i] is of length 4
- takes one of two different forms: "x==y" or "x!=y".
- x and y are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.

Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
