Quote from [HTDP](https://htdp.org/)
* ... many elements of the general design recipe apply to the design of algorithms ... The key to designing algorithms is the “generation” step, which often means **dividing up the problem. And figuring out a novel way of dividing a problem requires insight.**
* ... programmers must thoroughly understand the underlying ideas so that they can code up algorithms and have the program **communicate with future readers.** The best way to get acquainted with the idea is to **study a wide range of examples and to develop a sense for the kinds of generative recursions that may show up in the real world.**
